a.
`if 0 then 'a' else 'b'`
Error: No instance for (Num Bool) arising from the literal `0'
Fix: Replace 0 with false, as in other languages 0 is considered a false value.
Other langs: This error would not occur in other languages i know as 0 is also known to be the false boolean value

b.
`if 'a' == 'b' then 5`
Error:  parse error (possibly incorrect indentation or mismatched brackets)
Fix: add an else statement `if 'a' == 'b' then 5 else 0`
Other langs: No, just wouldnt return anything

c.
`if 'a' = 'b' then 5 else 4`
Error: not using a comparison operator, using an assignment
Fix: replace `=` with `==` `if 'a' = 'b' then 5 else 4`
Other langs: Yes, cant use `=` for comparison

d.
`if 0 == 0 then 5 else 'b'`
Error: using mismatching types for the outputs
Fix: Replace 5 with '5' `if 0 == 0 then '5' else 'b'`
Other langs: Not in python but maybe more type strict languages

e.
`['0', 5, 9]`
Error: All types in array must be equal
Fix: `[0, 5, 9]`
Other langs: Maybe more type safe languages

f.
`('a', 42`
Error: Missing closing bracket
Fix: `('a', 42)`
Other langs: Yes

g.
`let sumSq m n = m^2 - n^2 in sumSq 3 4`
I dont see any error here?

h.
`let f (x:xs) = 42 in f []`
Error: Non-exhaustive patterns in function f
Fix: The error here is that x:xs means x is the head and xs is the tail, so for this we can remove the xs as we are given an empty list `let f (x) = 42 in f []`
